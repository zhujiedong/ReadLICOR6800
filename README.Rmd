## Purpose

This package is use to read the data of LI-6800 photosynthesis system from LICOR. Currently it only contains 2 functions, one is for read a single excel file (`read_li6800`), and another (`read_li6800_folder`) is read a folder contains data files from LI-6800 as a dataframe, with a coloum of tags.

## Important

I use `readxl` to read the excel data, but you have to select **Options ---> formula ---> Enable iterative calculation** before use the package, or otherwise it will be failed in reading the excel cells that have formulas.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ReadLICOR6800 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zhujiedong/ReadLICOR6800")
```

## Example

### Read a single file

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ReadLICOR6800)
aci <- read_li6800('inst/extdata/racirtest1.xlsx')
aci[1:3, 1:6]
names(aci)
aci$data_tag
```

by use the default arguments, the returned dataframe will contain a new column contains the name of the file called `data_tag`, it is used to distinguish files when reading all the files in a folder. the `data_tag` can also be changed to a custom one, use the `tags="custom tags"`, where `custom tags` is what you need. 

if you need to read only one file, it is not needed:

```{r}
aci <- read_li6800("inst/extdata/racirtest1.xlsx", add_tags = FALSE)
names(aci)
head(aci$data_tags)
```

### Read all files from a folder

It is similar with `read_li6800`, but usually we may need to specify the tags to distinguish the combined dataframe that from lots of excel files, if `tags=NULL`(default), `data_tag`column will use the file name as a tag:


```{r}
list.files("inst/extdata/")

aci <- read_li6800_folder("inst/extdata/")
names(aci)
head(aci$data_tag)
tail(aci$data_tag)
```
when use custom tags, make sure the tags have the right order and right length with what the `list.files()` shows

```{r}
aci <- read_li6800_folder("inst/extdata/", tags = paste('test', 1:2))
aci[1:3, 1:6]
names(aci)
head(aci$data_tag)
tail(aci$data_tag)
```
